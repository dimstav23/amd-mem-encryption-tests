# TSME Test Module
The TSME test module is a loadable Linux kernel module that can
be used to determine the state of TSME and SME.

In order to determine if TSME is active, the SME feature must be
enabled, but it does not need to be active (the kernel does not
need to have been booted with mem_encrypt=on).

The TSME test module will create a sysfs file if no errors are
encountered while loading the module: /sys/kernel/tsme. If TSME
is active, the /sys/kernel/tsme file will report 1. If TSME is
not active, the /sys/kernel/tsme file will report 0.

To build:
1. Adjust the path to the kernel dev files [here](./Makefile)
2. Run `make`

To install:
1. Run `insmod ./tsme-test.ko` (root access is required)

In addition to creating the sysfs file, loading the module will
generate kernel messages that can also be used to determine the
status of TSME.

On top of that, the TSME test is enhanced to verify the functionality
of AMD SME (provided that the TSME check is performed successfully).
Additional kernel messages are produced indicating buffer states
w/ and w/o the encryption bit. 

To view these messages, simply run `dmesg`.

Don't forget that you have to `rmmod tsme-test` before rerunning 
the test.
